## Resurrección Toolkit

UPDATE: Right now this tool is under a CLOSED RELEASE version 1.0.0.0, in order to be a part of this release join the Discord and ask politely; from there we will see how things go. The work here is being considered to become OPEN SOURCE upon release, this is the most likely outcome although things may change.

UPDATE 2: ~~Current project is on hiatus until I am able to find the free time to work on it again. The project is planned for eventualy completion, however.~~

UPDATE 3: The project is back to being worked out, due to certain circumstances it is not being worked on all of the time however when it is being worked out significant updates are being made. A new library and program has been made from scratch which far surpases the older tool. Better GUI and update-friendliness are expected with new version.

## Resurrección Toolkit

UPDATE: Right now this tool is under a CLOSED RELEASE version 1.0.0.0, in order to be a part of this release join the Discord and ask politely; from there we will see how things go. The work here is being considered to become OPEN SOURCE upon release, this is the most likely outcome although things may change.

UPDATE 2: Current project is on hiatus until I am able to find the free time to work on it again. The project is planned for eventualy completion, however.

### Info
